Library Management System:
Welcome to my Library Management System! This project features a simple implementation of a library system, complete with the ability to manage books, borrow and return them, and even handle digital downloads.

Overview
This system consists of three main classes:

Book: Represents a book with properties like title, author, ISBN, and availability. It includes methods for borrowing and returning books.

Library: Manages a collection of Book instances. It allows adding and removing books, viewing the current collection, and finding books by title.

DigitalLibrary: Extends the Library class to include functionality for downloadable books. It checks if a book is available for download based on its availability and inclusion in a downloadable list.

You can test the functionality by running the code directly or by adding more test cases to explore different scenarios.
